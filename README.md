# SQL-Project-2
The project involves a comprehensive data cleaning and transformation process on a dataset related to world layoffs. The main steps include:

Creating a New Table:

Create a staging table (layoffs_staging) to work with a copy of the raw data.
Removing Duplicates:

Identify and remove duplicate records based on key attributes using window functions and intermediate tables.
Standardizing Data:

Standardize data fields (e.g., trimming whitespace, normalizing industry and country names, and converting date formats).
Handling Null or Blank Values:

Identify and address null or blank values in key columns, filling in missing values where possible.
Removing Unnecessary Rows and Columns:

Delete rows with insufficient information and drop columns no longer needed for analysis.
This process ensures the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for subsequent analysis or reporting.
