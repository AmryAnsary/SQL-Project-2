# SQL-Project-2
The project involves a comprehensive data cleaning and transformation process on a dataset related to world layoffs. The main steps include:

1. Creating a New Table:
Create a staging table (layoffs_staging) to work with a copy of the raw data.

2. Removing Duplicates:
Identify and remove duplicate records based on key attributes using window functions and intermediate tables.

3. Standardizing Data:
Standardize data fields (e.g., trimming whitespace, normalizing industry and country names, and converting date formats).

4. Handling Null or Blank Values:
Identify and address null or blank values in key columns, filling in missing values where possible.

5. Removing Unnecessary Rows and Columns:
Delete rows with insufficient information and drop columns no longer needed for analysis.

This process ensures the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for subsequent analysis or reporting.
